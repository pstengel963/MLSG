# MLSG
Machine Learning Study Group

Notes and notebooks from the MLSG meetings of the Ferrara Cosmology group. The goal of the study group is to get a basic understanding of Machine Learning through discussions guided by a series of informal lectures on selected topics described in the notes and supplemented by interactive examples provided by the collection of associated Jupyter notebooks. The meetings started in Spring 2023 and will continue in Autumn 2023.

The notes are based on material aggregated from the references listed in the bibliography. The notebooks are a combination of adaptations of previous notebooks provided by the authors of those references, often using popular Machine Learning packages to investigate practical examples, and more basic examples written from scratch to make the connection more transparent between the notes and the more complicated examples.

The material is currently focused on supervised learning techniques including linear models, deep neural networks and decision trees. Plans for future topics include more advanced supervised techniques in addition to weakly or unsupervised learning. While the more practical examples include a variety of applications, including those associated with particle physics, we also plan to focus on examples more directly relevant for cosmology.
